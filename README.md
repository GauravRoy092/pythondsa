# Python DSA Hub

Welcome to **Python DSA Hub** – your one-stop repository for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using Python! Whether you're a beginner grinding LeetCode or a pro sharpening your skills, this repo has got you covered with clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

## 🚀 What’s This About?

This repository is a collection of Python implementations for various Data Structures and Algorithms. My goal? To break down complex concepts into simple, readable code that you can learn from, tweak, or use directly in your projects. Expect regular updates as I keep adding more problems, solutions, and optimizations!

## 📂 Repository Structure

Here’s how the repo is organized:

Each folder contains Python files with:
- Problem statement (in comments)
- Solution code
- Time and Space Complexity analysis

## 🔥 Features

- **Beginner-Friendly**: Code is written with clarity in mind – no cryptic one-liners (unless it’s intentional 😎).
- **Well-Commented**: Understand *why* the code works, not just *how*.
- **Optimized Solutions**: Where possible, I’ve included multiple approaches (brute force to optimized).
- **Pythonic Code**: Leveraging Python’s power for concise and elegant solutions.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GauravRoy092/pythondsa.git

   Example :- python binary_search_tree.py
